# Spaceflex

A WIP collection of libraries for purely functional distributed programming in Reflex FRP.

The libraries prefixed by `webflex` are for client-server web programming, while the (yet to come) `spaceflex` libraries are for general distributed programming.

See `webflex-todomvc` for a client-server version of `reflex-todomvc`.

Run `nix-shell --run "cabal run exe:sim-test"` for a simulated global button counter app.
